This release contains implementations from paper
"Fast Iterative Graph Computation with Block Updates" (VLDB 2013).

This is a preliminary release for people who are interested in graph processing and reproduce the experimental results.
It is not a complete release of the GRACE system. Please let us know if you have any questions.

=== Downloading/Installing Cornell DB Utility Libraries ===

    Run
        git clone https://github.com/FreePeter/DBUtl.git

    to download the Cornell DB Utility Library code.
	
    After downloading the code, run
        make install
		
    to install the library into /usr/libaray. Alternatively, you can install it into other place by define the environmental variable CUDB_PREFIX (e.g., declare it in .bashrc)


=== Downloading/Compiling GRACE ===
    Run
        git clone https://github.com/FreePeter/BlockGRACE.git

    to download the GRACE engine code. We will refer this folder as the "GRACE folder".

    After downloading the code, run
        ./script/compileAll.sh

    to compile all the 3 applications (personalpr, eik3d, sssp) and generate the corresponding executable files in the exec/ folder.


=== Downloading Data Files  ===
	
    Download the data from https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B91zl_48PQe1RlMzc2lXeTNLSDQ&usp=sharing 
    Please download them into the data/ folder.

    After downloading them, run the following commands under the data/ folder
        tar xvf *.bz2

=== Running Experiments ===
    Run the following script to reproduce the experiments. The experiments will use 8 worker threads and more than 16G memory. So please run it on a 8-core machine with at least 32G main memory.
        ./script/runall.sh
